    Fix flaky test TestTransfer
    
    This test was checking that it received every progress update that was
    produced. But delivery of these intermediate progress updates is not
    guaranteed. A new update can overwrite the previous one if the previous
    one hasn't been sent to the channel yet.
    
    The call to t.Fatalf exited the current goroutine which was consuming
    the channel, which caused a deadlock and eventual test timeout rather
    than a proper failure message.
    
    Failure seen here:
