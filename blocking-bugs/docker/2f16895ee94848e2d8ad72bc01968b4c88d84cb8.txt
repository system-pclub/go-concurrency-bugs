    devmapper: Drop devices lock before returning from function
    
    cleanupDeleted() takes devices.Lock() but does not drop it if there are
    no deleted devices. Hence docker deadlocks if one is using deferred
    device deletion feature. (--storage-opt dm.use_deferred_deletion=true).
    
    Fix it. Drop the lock before returning.
    
    Also added a unit test case to make sure in future this can be easily
    detected if somebody changes the function.
